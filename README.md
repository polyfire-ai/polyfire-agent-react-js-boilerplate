# Polyfire Agent React Javascript Boilerplate

This project is a boilerplate setup for building React applications using Javascript. It includes essential dependencies and configurations to kickstart the development of a Polyfire agent application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/polyfire-agent-react-ts-boilerplate.git
cd polyfire-agent-react-ts-boilerplate
```

### Installation

Install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

### Building for Production

To build the app for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.

### Running Tests

Execute tests using the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### Ejecting Configuration

**Note**: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

```bash
npm run eject
```
